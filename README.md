This is a JS project

Purpose:
The Mapty project aims to teach you how to use the Leaflet library for mapping, as well as how to effectively handle user interactions, workouts, and data management through JavaScript.

Main Features:
Map Integration: Utilizes OpenStreetMap through the Leaflet library to display a map where users can log their workout routes.
User Interaction: Users can click on the map to create markers representing where workouts occurred. This is supported by pop-ups displaying workout details.
Workout Logging: Users can enter workout details, including type (running, cycling), distance, duration, and more.
Data Storage: Workouts are stored in the browser's local storage, allowing users to revisit their workout history even after refreshing the page.

Learning Points in JavaScript:
DOM Manipulation: Gain experience working with the DOM to create and display HTML elements dynamically based on user input.
Map Handling: Learn to integrate external libraries for map functionality, including adding markers and pop-ups.
Asynchronous Programming: Understand how to handle asynchronous data fetching and storage, as well as user events through event listeners.
Object-Oriented Programming: Structure your code effectively using classes to manage different types of workouts and their associated properties.
